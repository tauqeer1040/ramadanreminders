This skill covers three areas. Read the relevant reference doc before proceeding.

## API — REST API wrapper & auth

Use when: making API calls, managing projects/paywalls/campaigns, bootstrapping org structure, or setting up API keys.

→ [references/api.md](references/api.md)

Quick start:

```bash
scripts/sw-api.sh bootstrap
```

## Data & Analytics — ClickHouse data warehouse

Use when: querying event data, analyzing revenue/subscriptions, running SQL against Superwall's ClickHouse tables, or investigating user behavior.

→ [references/data-analytics.md](references/data-analytics.md)

Query endpoint:

```bash
scripts/sw-api.sh -m POST -d 'SELECT ... FORMAT CSVWithNames' /v2/organizations/:organizationId/query
```

## Docs — Documentation, SDK integration, dashboard links

Use when: looking up Superwall docs, integrating an SDK, linking to dashboard pages, cloning SDK source for debugging, or configuring webhooks.

→ [references/docs.md](references/docs.md)

Doc lookup:

```bash
curl -sL https://superwall.com/docs/llms.txt        # Find the right page
curl -sL https://superwall.com/docs/{path}.md        # Fetch a specific page
```
